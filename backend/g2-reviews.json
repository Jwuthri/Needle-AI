With the drag and drop interface you can easily build custom dashboards, track your tasks, or link websites. I like best how it hook up with Slack and Google Calendar and you can organize anything related to work. It\u2019s so customizable you can almost have a workspace for both personal and business use. By having everything in one place I do not need to switch between apps all the time but rather have it streamline my day to day workflow. Dislikes: The only problem with the offline mode in Notion is that it doesn\u2019t work too well, and it has an issue that when my internet is not too stable. It has only delayed me when I needed those notes during a meeting. The search functionality is an another drawback as it fails trace older files. The features are also complicated with sailing, so it makes onboarding slower for new team members, which in turn gets in the way of efficiency with workflow. Problems Solved: A central place for documentation has solved our team's communication and task tracking issues and Notion has done that. We hadn\u2019t had much luck keeping track of project updates that were getting scattered across emails and spreadsheets. We now team up in real time, setting tasks and instant messaging our updates. That has helped us to get more organized and it saves time and increases productivity. For instance, we make tracking our content from the idea to the publication stage much easier in one workspace now.",

I love how it keeps everything organized and accessible in one place, allowing me to track my tasks, notes, and projects efficiently. The flexibility to customize pages and databases to suit my needs makes it easy to stay on top of my work. Whether I'm managing deadlines, taking quick notes, or planning larger projects, I can always check Notion to see where I stand and what needs my attention. It\u2019s a go-to tool for keeping everything in order, and I feel more productive knowing that I have everything I need right at my fingertips. Dislikes: On the flip side, Notion isn't the most beginner-friendly app, especially for those just starting out with productivity tools. The steep learning curve can be intimidating, as there are so many features and customization options that it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed. For someone new to organizing their workflow or managing tasks digitally, it can feel like there\u2019s too much going on at once. Setting up basic structures, such as databases or linked pages, can be confusing without prior experience, which may turn off people who just want something simple to use from the get-go. Problems Solved: Before using Notion, I used a mix of apps to manage tasks, notes, and projects. I had one app for to-do lists, another for meeting notes, and yet another for managing longer-term projects. This created a lot of mental clutter, and I constantly found myself jumping between different tools. Notion solves this by consolidating all my information in one place. Whether it's task management, notes, or even brainstorming ideas, I can keep everything in one easy-to-access workspace. This has made my workflow much more efficient. Long-term projects can get messy when using traditional to-do lists or basic project management tools. Notion allows me to break down these projects into smaller, manageable tasks, add deadlines, and visualize them in different formats (e.g., Kanban boards, calendars). This structured approach makes it easier to stay on track and avoid missing important steps or milestones.",

Its user-friendly interface allows you to navigate and customize the platform according to your needs. It's amazing to share information with my colleagues and personalize it. In addition, it has a wide range of templates and customization options, making it adaptable for different use cases. In terms of collaboration and work sharing, Notion facilitates information exchange by allowing team members to share pages, databases and documents. It also offers real-time editing and commenting capabilities, which facilitates teamwork and project progress. At my company, we use it to share the job catalogs, benefits, office policies, etc. Is our primary tool to share information along the company. Finally, Notion's database capabilities enable users to create relational databases, allowing them to effectively manage and organize complex information. Dislikes: Although it is very intuitive, it can have a somewhat high learning curve, especially for users who are new to the platform. In my case, I had to use some YouTube tutorials to be able to use it smoothly. When someone is a new user, we need to spend some time explaining basic usage information, because is not intuitive at first. When you are a more experienced user I think is an amazing tool. In addition, you may experience performance issues with large databases or complex pages, resulting in slow load times and occasional delays. Its offline capabilities are also limited, which can make it difficult to work without a reliable Internet connection. The mobile version of Notion is useful but is missing certain features and may be less intuitive. In addition, for larger teams or companies, Notion's advanced features come at a cost, which can be expensive for startups or small businesses. In addition, Notion's data export options are limited, which can be a drawback for those who need to back up or transfer their information to other systems. Problems Solved: Notion addresses several key issues in managing information and communication in the workplace, providing a great benefit to our company. It helps me share essential information effectively with employees, including company policies, salary structures, job catalogs and employee benefits. This centralized platform ensures that all team members have access to the latest information, promoting transparency and consistency. In addition, Notion's collaboration features allow for real-time updates and feedback, improving overall productivity and alignment within the team. Its intuitive design and customization options make it easy to organize and present information in a clear and accessible way, making it an invaluable tool for managing and disseminating important company information. So it's amazing to have a place where we can share a lot of valuable information, links related, images, videos, etc. So when someone has questions about any policy or process, usually we send the Notion link beside of explaining it every time. I save a lot of time thanks to Notion.",

Its user-friendly interface allows you to navigate and customize the platform according to your needs. It's amazing to share information with my colleagues and personalize it.\nIn addition, it has a wide range of templates and customization options, making it adaptable for different use cases. In terms of collaboration and work sharing, Notion facilitates information exchange by allowing team members to share pages, databases and documents. It also offers real-time editing and commenting capabilities, which facilitates teamwork and project progress.\nAt my company, we use it to share the job catalogs, benefits, office policies, etc. Is our primary tool to share information along the company.\nFinally, Notion's database capabilities enable users to create relational databases, allowing them to effectively manage and organize complex information.",
      "dislikes": "Although it is very intuitive, it can have a somewhat high learning curve, especially for users who are new to the platform. In my case, I had to use some YouTube tutorials to be able to use it smoothly.\nWhen someone is a new user, we need to spend some time explaining basic usage information, because is not intuitive at first. When you are a more experienced user I think is an amazing tool.\nIn addition, you may experience performance issues with large databases or complex pages, resulting in slow load times and occasional delays.\nIts offline capabilities are also limited, which can make it difficult to work without a reliable Internet connection.

    "content": "A Game-changer Likes: The real game-changer for me was the flexibility. I started by setting up a simple to-do list and quickly moved on to creating detailed project boards for each client. One of my favorite features is the ability to create interconnected databases. For instance, I set up a client database that links directly to individual project pages. This means I can see at a glance which stage each project is at, deadlines, and any outstanding tasks. The collaborative features are stellar too; I\u2019ve been able to share specific pages with clients for feedback, and they can leave comments directly on the document. The integration with Google Drive has also been a lifesaver, making it easy to pull in assets and resources. Dislikes: But it\u2019s not all sunshine and rainbows. The learning curve was definitely steeper than I anticipated. The sheer amount of customization options was a bit overwhelming at first, and it took some time to figure out how to best structure my workspace. Also, while the desktop version is fantastic, the mobile app leaves much to be desired. I often found it clunky and less intuitive, which made on-the-go updates a bit frustrating. Performance can also dip when loading particularly large pages or databases, which was a minor annoyance. Problems Solved: When I first stumbled upon Notion, I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to expect. It felt like yet another productivity tool promising the world. But after a few weeks of using it, I can honestly say it\u2019s become an indispensable part of my daily routine.

This makes the process of setting up the workflow slow in the beginning but very intentional. It is very good for people, teams and workspaces that are still trying to figure out what works for them, or where individuals or teams require a degree of autonomy to organize their own workspace on their terms and preferences, or in business environments that demand a lot of agility and iteration. Another thing that i love about notion is its ability to bring in transparency to any workspace by providing what they call a 'single source of truth' through the utilization of relational database management systems (RDBMS) as repositories of files, tasks and units of information. The new features vis-a-vis AI are like steroids to the existing experience. Lastly, I love the clean look and interface, and the ability to compose the workspace just adds a whole new depth to imagining the information architecture of the entire organisational setup. Dislikes: The fact that it has no integrated chat feature or ability to embed video conferencing, makes the entire work conversation incomplete. I have to move to Slack to complete the integration, but like there is a pull out chat/dialogue box for AI features, there should be a chatbox for just text based chat inputs specific to each page, that has visibility to every player that can access the page. It would make the entire experience complete. Problems Solved: - Allows me to create custom workflows - Clean and minimal interface makes it accomodating, anxiety free and less daunting for new users to learn - Notion Academy is a very helpful learning resource that helps the new users understand the use case of Notion rather than just loading their head with features - Allows for a pace that makes the design of organisational structure and information architecture of the workspace very intentional and reasoned - Allows for iteration and composition that is critically missing in other softwares - Allows for data storage and embedding, and with AI that is being given a boost. Again missing in other project management softwares largely, or the ease of use is much less. - Has fostered transparency and communication and reduced errors, double work and miscommunication. Has enhanced measurement of performance and accountability. - Has promoted design and systems thinking in the organisation and has facilitated discussion around work methodologies, team structures, and roles in a depth and detail that wasn't possible before. - Allows for framing of information through use of databases that makes it simpler too understand at a glance without the need of another person explaining it, which has made onboarding or replacement very easy",

      "dislikes": "The fact that it has no integrated chat feature or ability to embed video conferencing, makes the entire work conversation incomplete. I have to move to Slack to complete the integration, but like there is a pull out chat/dialogue box for AI features, there should be a chatbox for just text based chat inputs specific to each page, that has visibility to every player that can access the page. It would make the entire experience complete.",
      "problems_solved": "- Allows me to create custom workflows\n- Clean and minimal interface makes it accomodating, anxiety free and less daunting for new users to learn\n- Notion Academy is a very helpful learning resource that helps the new users understand the use case of Notion rather than just loading their head with features\n- Allows for a pace that makes the design of organisational structure and information architecture of the workspace very intentional and reasoned\n- Allows for iteration and composition that is critically missing in other softwares\n- Allows for data storage and embedding, and with AI that is being given a boost. Again missing in other project management softwares largely, or the ease of use is much less.\n- Has fostered transparency and communication and reduced errors, double work and miscommunication. Has enhanced measurement of performance and accountability.\n- Has promoted design and systems thinking in the organisation and has facilitated discussion around work methodologies, team structures, and roles in a depth and detail that wasn't possible before.\n- Allows for framing of information through use of databases that makes it simpler too understand at a glance without the need of another person explaining it, which has made onboarding or replacement very easy",

    "content": "Highly flexible, with its effectiveness varying greatly depending on how it is used. Likes: We utilize this tool for task management in internal projects. Since management items can be freely configured for each space, it\u2019s highly convenient for adapting to the specific needs of each project or individual management level. Additionally, integrating it with Google Calendar allows the home screen to display a combination of scheduled events and tasks, making it very easy to check what needs to be done today. We also link meeting notes transcribed using another tool into Notion and leverage its AI features. For example, by asking questions like, \"What opinions were raised about xxxx?\", we can quickly extract the information we need, which is incredibly valuable. With so many features available, I feel there\u2019s still much to learn in mastering its full potential. However, it\u2019s clear that this is a versatile tool with great potential for expanding its use depending on your ideas. Dislikes: For instance, having a feature that allows tasks from another space to be referenced and synchronized with private tasks would be incredibly helpful. This would enable individuals to manage their personal tasks while also reflecting updates in shared project tasks seamlessly. In terms of UI, while the tool is highly functional and user-friendly, the overall screen design feels somewhat faint, making it challenging to create visual distinctions. As the number of pages and tasks increases, it becomes harder to navigate. I believe it would be much more intuitive if conditions or settings could allow for color changes or emphasis, making it easier to visually organize and distinguish elements. Problems Solved: Sharing tasks within the team has become much easier. Since we are handling multiple projects simultaneously and across various areas, organizing and sharing tasks effectively has been a challenge. While we are still exploring the best ways to utilize the tool, we are optimistic that improvements can be made.",

I keep all my ideas, thoughts, plans, product details, research material etc. at one location with it. I have tried so many tools to manage my knowledge but then it becomes too messy for me to manage. I have moved from randomly created Excels for my research, Onenote, Airtable, Obsidian and so many other platforms but since nobody solves my problem completely, I come back to Notion. We use office 365 suite which has a competing product - Microsoft loop - which i also tried my hands on. But it is so buggy amd limiting that I detest it and it becomes a drag in front of robustness and smoothness of Notion.

There's a lot of templates I can choose from to set up each page to work the way I want. Each page can be shared to anyone I want (can only view) or you can give someone access to your workspace so they can edit. When I copy and paste anything to my Notion, I don't have to worry about formatting etc. because it always does a default font and size for everything (which saves me a lot of time at work). One unique thing I use is the 1:1 template to track what I do day-to-day, making it easier to remember what on what day. I use it daily \u2013without it, I won't be as organized with all my things and be successful. Dislikes: One downside is that when I leave a page, if I go back to the page, it always makes me go back to the top instead of where I last left off. This only impacts the pages where it's lengthy and detailed, but if you have short notes, then it's not really an issue. Other than that, no cons that I know of. Problems Solved: Organization for sure. One issue is that there is lack of documentation or documents were everywhere and not in one place as a source of truth. I utilize Notion to solve this issue by organizing information in one place. Keeping track of notes from meetings is easier to track in Notion compared to other platforms.

There's a lot of templates I can choose from to set up each page to work the way I want. Each page can be shared to anyone I want (can only view) or you can give someone access to your workspace so they can edit. When I copy and paste anything to my Notion, I don't have to worry about formatting etc. because it always does a default font and size for everything (which saves me a lot of time at work). One unique thing I use is the 1:1 template to track what I do day-to-day, making it easier to remember what on what day. I use it daily  \u2013without it, I won't be as organized with all my things and be successful.",

It has integrated AI and serves as a one-stop shop for note-taking, travel planning, social media calendars, etc. I have set up my entire business processes through Notion. What especially stands out to me is the page system. I am also very fond of the keyboard shortcuts (for bullets, headings, and color), which I learned specifically to increase my efficiency. Overall, I have integrated Notion into my daily scheduling and note-taking, and I am very happy with it. Dislikes: I have two minor dislikes about Notion - 1. Exporting - Exporting should have more options. Even for PDFs, there should be options to edit how you want the PDF to look. Sometimes the PDF ends up not being formated as per the Notion page. It would be helpful to have editing options before exporting. 2. Table Cells - There is immense potential for notion to create better table cells. They should be easy to use, and have more intuitve formulas. There should be options to add formulas to individual cells. Problems Solved: As I mentioned - for me notion is a one-stop shop for note-taking, travel planning, social media calendars, business plans, etc. It is solving the problem of unproductivity for me through the following way - It is very convenient to have all features like embedded maps and websites, pages, tables, databases calendars etc in one application.

Since I was instroduced to it by my ex-colleague, I\u2019ve been using it for everything, from work projects to personal to-do lists, and it\u2019s just so flexible and easy to use. You can literally customize it any way you want, which is perfect for organizing my chaotic brain (my neurodivergent colleagues swear by it too) . Plus it\u2019s all in one place. No more jumping between apps for notes, tasks, and databases. And on top of that it integrates into other apps like Slack and Glean, which makes searching for documentation feel like real life magic. I also love how you can collaborate with your team in real-time. It makes working on projects together so smooth. Plus, all the templates available are a huge time-saver. I had to create separate meetings for multiple teams in my org to tell them how to use the basics of Notion so they can drop their outdated excel sheets and move over to the great side. In all fairness, they still are yet to discover full functionality of Notion, but they seem sold already. If you haven\u2019t tried Notion yet, you\u2019re seriously missing out. Dislikes: I got nothing to complain about, but based on feedback from my colleagues: Notion can be a bit overwhelming for first-time users, especially if they\u2019ve never used a knowledge base before. With so many features and templates, it\u2019s easy to get sidetracked. It would be great if there was a setup wizard with multiple questions to help pre-build a space based on your needs, using some helpful text prompts to guide you along the way. Problems Solved: Notion helps us by being a single knowledge base where we store all our docs and processes. It's super helpful that we can integrate Google Drive files, so people who prefer using those can keep everything organized. Personally, I use Notion for my to-do lists, which I can share with colleagues when I'm out of the office or swamped with other projects.

    "content": "Incredibly adaptable shared workspace with a very steep learning curve Likes: Notion is a very friendly, sleek, wonderful looking shared workspace. Pages look great by default with very little extra work, but can also be modified heavily with advanced methods. Their website also has a lot of free and paid templates to show just how different pages can look and how many different things it can do. The ability to nest data heavily into itself is also a great feature, and makes workspaces very easy to organize. The ability to have shared workspaces and private workspaces separate on the same document is also great. Dislikes: Notion's learning curve is very steep. The UI is very friendly on the surface, and easy to get the hang of, but after getting further into it you realize how incredibly dependent Notion is on tables/databases. Which is fantastic in theory, but they haven't made the process of adding or updating tables very user friendly. Once you get the hang of it it's wonderful and easy to apply to so many problems, but it took me days of pouring over tutorials to really understand Notion as well as I wanted to. I haven't had to do that with many other programs. I would heavily consider the computer literacy of your team before adding Notion to your workspace, and possibly consider using only experienced Notion users to manage your data on it. I'm also not sure why they decided to make Notion Calendar an entirely separate program, but it does affect my workflow. I would expect calendars to be something I could nest inside an existing page very easily. Which you can, technically, using tables. But it's not as easily integrated as I would have hoped. Problems Solved: Notion is fantastic for organizing things we need to keep track of, and putting them in a space that everyone can see and access easily.",

Which is fantastic in theory, but they haven't made the process of adding or updating tables very user friendly. Once you get the hang of it it's wonderful and easy to apply to so many problems, but it took me days of pouring over tutorials to really understand Notion as well as I wanted to. I haven't had to do that with many other programs.\nI would heavily consider the computer literacy of your team before adding Notion to your workspace, and possibly consider using only experienced Notion users to manage your data on it.\nI'm also not sure why they decided to make Notion Calendar an entirely separate program, but it does affect my workflow. I would expect calendars to be something I could nest inside an existing page very easily. Which you can, technically, using tables. But it's not as easily integrated as I would have hoped.",

I love that I can create sub-pages, toggled content, to-do lists, and mood boards in one spot. The primary ways I use it are: 1) To organize client projects. I have a reusable template that I can easily customize for each project and share it with my clients. I LOVE how easy it is to share with clients. 2) To organize all the moving parts of my business such as a task calendar, content for blog posts, partnerships I have with brands, collaborations with other businesses, my SEO strategy, code back-ups, and a place to store brand assets, etc. 3) To help generate ideas for content! I am loving the AI writing assistant. I love to write and blogging is my primary marketing strategy. I use the writing assistant to help me generate ideas for posts and create outlines that I can then add my own ideas to. It is also AMAZING for tedious stuff like writing meta descriptions for Pinterest pins or web pages. I love that there is very little friction to get started with it. You can use it for very basic stuff like I do or you can develop more complex systems if you really want to dive in. Dislikes: As a designer, I would love some more ability to customize the appearance of the stuff that I share with my clients. There are some customizations but they are minimal. It would also be great if they had more features for client-facing stuff such as forms (kind of like what Tally does-though you can integrate Notion and Tally, which I do!). Problems Solved: I am a solopreneur and my business has multiple arms. Client-facing, e-commerce, and partnerships And also do all organic marketing. So if I didn't have a place that I could put all of this, that was easy to use and customize, I would have a harder time running my business. I think the fact that it is so easy to dash something off in Notion, and find it again when I need it allows me to harness creative ideas that I might otherwise lose. As far as writing content, using the AI writing assistant has been a game-changer! I have been able to post more consistently on my blog which has led to better SEO, more traffic, and more income. It's easy to access it anywhere in Notion, on any page which is great. I have found the quality of the ideas that the AI provides to be really useful.

    "content": "Notion is great for every aspect of my life! Likes: I love the calendar feature because it lets me organize my weeks, create checklists, and syncs up to my Google calendar on my phone. The versatility of the different features and their ease of use lets me customize each page to whatever I need. Large card-views help me to make different class agendas for the subjects I assist in teaching, toggle menus help to create flash cards that are easy to rearrange by dragging and dropping, and the outline options with bullets, colors, and highlights is amazing for taking notes and streamlining them later. The AI is also a feature I use every day. Whenever I need a summary of a text for a quick review or clarification of subject matter, it is a reliable assistant and teacher to help me learn independently! Dislikes: I don't think there is anything that I particularly dislike about Notion. I originally felt slightly put off that the calendar feature added yet another tool for me to juggle, but now that it syncs with my Google calendar, I have everything I need no matter what device or platform I am on. Problems Solved: Notion lets me be organized in a way I have never experienced before.

      "likes": "I love the calendar feature because it lets me organize my weeks, create checklists, and syncs up to my Google calendar on my phone. The versatility of the different features and their ease of use lets me customize each page to whatever I need. Large card-views help me to make different class agendas for the subjects I assist in teaching, toggle menus help to create flash cards that are easy to rearrange by dragging and dropping, and the outline options with bullets, colors, and highlights is amazing for taking notes and streamlining them later. The AI is also a feature I use every day. Whenever I need a summary of a text for a quick review or clarification of subject matter, it is a reliable assistant and teacher to help me learn independently!",
      "dislikes": "I don't think there is anything that I particularly dislike about Notion. I originally felt slightly put off that the calendar feature added yet another tool for me to juggle, but now that it syncs with my Google calendar, I have everything I need no matter what device or platform I am on.",

It is easy to set up Notion and quickly get to creating notes.

The color coding feature is also a very useful feature with the help of which I can color different points in different colors and can personally assign any importance to it. Also, the less amount of fonts is actually a pro for me because I don't need to think much about font and font size and try to overcustomize the notes and can straightaway get to making notes itself. The different templates present in the notion, the database feature, views, basic templating make in itself enough features to provide a note taking application with the help of which I can create personal documentation for myself as well as a knowledge base for the organization. Dislikes: One thing, I dislike about notion is that I cannot create offline notes nor I can store the notes in my own system in the form of markdown files or any other format.

It gives you the canvas and tools to build whatever pages, databases, wikis, or boards you need to organize your life or business. And if you're not a do-it-yourselfer, there are hundreds of pre-built templates from fellow Notion users. If you're looking for a dedicated CRM, project management, or goal tracker tool, you'll find other dedicated products with more robust features, but if you want to consolidate all of these services and more into a single, affordable, software, you won't find anything better than Notion. I use Notion every single day for everything from household finances and home projects to client and project tracking for my freelance business. Dislikes: Notion's feature set currently lacks in a few areas: (although each of these are listed as upcoming features by the Notion team) - Workflow automation options are limited, with only a few triggers/actions to choose from. The public API is nice, and there are a lot of out-of-the-box integrations offered, but Webhooks and more automation options would go a long way. - Database permissions are limited in that it's impossible to grant different users/groups permissions to different subsets of the data in a database. This is especially frustrating if you want a common database driving task/project management across your entire organization but don't want all tasks visible to everyone. - Database templates that are built or updated after some of the database is populated can not be automatically applied to all existing database entries. This makes for a tedious process if you want all entrys in the database to have a common look/feel.

      "dislikes": "Unlike tools like Obsidian, Notion is online-only; there is no reliable offline mode. When I'm off the grid, or with unreliable wifi, Notion crashes and burns.",

Intelligent Content Suggestions - One of NotionAI's standout features is its AI-powered content suggestions. It analyzes your notes and suggests related content, helping you discover connections and ideas you might have missed otherwise. This feature significantly enhances creativity and productivity. Collaboration and Sharing - NotionAI excels in facilitating collaboration among teams. It allows real-time co-editing, commenting, and task assignment, making it an ideal tool for remote and distributed teams. The ability to share specific pages or databases with external collaborators is a significant advantage. Cross-Platform Accessibility - NotionAI is available on various platforms, including web, desktop, and mobile applications. This ensures that users can access and update their information seamlessly, regardless of the device they're using. Robust Integration Ecosystem - NotionAI supports numerous integrations with third-party apps and services, enhancing its functionality and extending its use cases. This flexibility makes it adaptable to various workflows and preferences. Dislikes: Learning Curve- While NotionAI's versatility is a strength, it can also be a drawback for new users. The learning curve can be steep, and some users may find it challenging to harness the full potential of the tool without comprehensive tutorials or guidance. Pricing - NotionAI offers a free plan with limited features, but the pricing for premium plans may be prohibitive for some users, particularly for small teams or individuals. A more flexible pricing structure or additional features in lower-tier plans could address this concern. Offline Functionality - NotionAI's dependence on an internet connection can be a limitation, especially for users who need to access their data offline. Improved offline functionality would be beneficial for users in such scenarios.Search and Organization - While NotionAI has search capabilities, some users have reported that it can be challenging to find specific information within a large workspace.

    "content": "Great tool for structuring internal data repository Likes: What I appreciate most about Notion is its integration of AI functions which significantly enhance productivity and organization. The ability to use smart templates and databases to automate tasks is a game changer. Notion\u2019s AI cleverly streamlines the process of managing information, from planning projects to tracking habits, all within an intuitive interface. The seamless synthesis of notes, tasks, and databases, powered by intelligent algorithms, makes it easier to connect ideas and get work done efficiently. Its AI capabilities help in transforming scattered thoughts into structured action plans, which is why I find it incredibly valuable. Dislikes: One aspect of Notion that can be challenging is its reliance on advanced features, such as AI, to perform basic functions. For instance, without the AI to assist, I find it quite cumbersome to manually create and manage tables or to organize content effectively. The platform has a steep learning curve, and the absence of intuitive AI-driven guidance makes it difficult for me to set up even fundamental structures like databases or to sort information logically. This dependency on AI for essential tasks can be a significant barrier to maximizing the potential of Notion for those not well-versed in its more complex functionalities.

I wish it could generate graphs, but I understand this isn't an excel document nor a google sheet. However the functionality of being able to integrate those functions natively to Notion databases would be superb. Another thing that might be offputting to some but I didn't really mind is that Notion has a steep learning curve.

By allowing the ability to create \"infinite\" pages through Notion, it allows the root page to act as a Category. This is great for breaking down blog post ideas and pre-emptively visualising how to structure the site before publishing anything. Their UI is also very easy and satisfying to use. Buttons do what you would expect and nothing feels out of place or \"janky\". With this in mind, it would make contacting customer support a breeze, since I would know where to find it. Dislikes: The main downside to Notion is its AI tool. While it is a great help in brainstorming ideas and fixing punctuation or grammar, it falls a little short in writing good-quality content. Some responses I would receive feel generic and lack more sophisticated thought than I would expect to receive from my prompt. That being said, I appreciate the level of sophistication in the current AI model and that user input is a key factor in the result of a prompt, but more variation in the results would be nice. Problems Solved: I personally use Notion to assist with my blogging website. I generally struggle with writing a solid blog post in the supplied software of the site, and much prefer using Notion to help with this.

The ability to leverage AI to organize content, check writing, and integrate seamlessly with websites and Google tools has greatly enhanced my productivity and efficiency. One of the standout features is the AI-powered content organization. It's incredible to see how AI algorithms can analyze and categorize large volumes of information, making it easier to find and access relevant content quickly. This has saved me countless hours of searching and scrolling, allowing me to focus more on the tasks at hand. The writing assistance provided by AI is another standout feature. Not only does it offer helpful grammar and spelling checks, but it also suggests improvements to sentence structure and overall clarity. This has significantly improved the quality of my writing and saved me from embarrassing mistakes. The seamless integration with websites and Google tools is also worth mentioning. Being able to have Notion seamlessly interact with other platforms and tools I use daily has streamlined my workflow and eliminated the need for manual data entry or switching between multiple applications. Everything is now in one place, making it much easier to stay organized and efficient. Lastly, the AI's creative capabilities have been a pleasant surprise. The ability to generate unique and inspiring content has sparked my creativity and allowed me to think outside the box. Whether it's coming up with new ideas or creating visually appealing designs, the AI integration in Notion has truly expanded my creative horizons. Overall, the integration of AI with Notion has transformed the way I work and has become an invaluable tool in my daily routine. Its ability to organize content, enhance my writing, seamlessly integrate with other tools, and unlock my creativity is simply remarkable.

The best part about it is that it improve your writing without going to over the top. For example when you ask chat gpt to improve your writing it no longer sounds like you. Notion has a happy in between. Dislikes: Tables were horrible, but they have gotten a little better. I still think they have a long way to go though. Would be great to be able to wrap text or have more customization over text. I prefer coda in this instance, but the whole company is on notion so its hard to swift. Problems Solved: The main problem that notion solves for me is a place to write product requirement docs. As a product manager this is its primary use case. We also use it for internal docs. Overall the best thing about notion now is that i can write in about 3x the speed with the ai integrations.",

All very intuitive and versatile. With the introduction of AI, it made it even more efficient to have notion as the primary space where I know I can count on viewing what I have to do on a daily basis, with the possibility to turn a vague brainstorm text into something coherent with just 1 click (improve writing), or to prepare any big text I'm sending to anyone with the \"Fix spelling & grammar\", which makes me very confident on sending anything to anyone. Sometimes I use the AI feature to brainstorm ideas or scenarios, to give me copy, or to split an activity into parts, as I ask the AI to, for example, be \"a UX director\" which then provides more detailed and in-depth points for me to take into account. Really love Notion and I intend to keep using it for a long time. Dislikes: Sometimes I wished that the AI would remember some of the work we did or ask for help, or even to act based on the previous prompt I made or the previous answer that was provided. I see myself sometimes using other AI platforms to have bigger brainstorming sessions, or much more detailed asks simply because I cannot develop an idea with AI on notion, there is no \"history tracking\" nor opportunity to \"conversate\" in order to reach the best solution. It would be cool to have it on a \"chat format\" that keeps track of the conversation, and on the requests and adjustments made throughout the whole process. If the AI on notion had these features I would definitely recommend the product 200% to everyone who works or studies. Problems Solved: Notion is helping me be more effective in my day-to-day work activities since it helps me stay on track with my tasks, but also supports the work I develop by doing minor and major adjustments.",

I use notion pretty much daily to plan for my business, do writing, manage life admin and finances, and keep notes for all my conversations and meetings. I especially love that I can pull it up on my phone anytime and quickly find whatever I want in minutes, even when I'm on the go! I love the notion template marketplace as well, you can always find a quick and easy way to create and make your processes faster! My new favourite tools have to be the built in AI which can do so many things for you, including tell you answers to content on a page!! So cool. Dislikes: There is very little I don't like about the notion, but sometimes the offline experiences can be questionable (but honestly, it's probably because I'm using the wrong settings). There can be a tiny learning curve when you're first using it, but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy to continue working in there forever. Problems Solved: - A clean workspace that had a clean and sophisticated design built into it - AI tooling built in and super easy to integrate into your routine with keyboard shortcuts. - An incredible free tier that you could use (almost) forever. - A super beautiful and customisable way to manage pretty much anything you're doing from the palm of your hand to your office. - it's lightweight and gives me just the right amount of tooling and information to build pages ready to be published in minutes better than you can in word/google docs(in docs you have to do hypercustom things to achieve the same result)! - incredible integrations with my favourite sites like Figma/Canva, so I can preview that work all in notion too!",

For instance, I used Notion to build a travel page for our upcoming family vacation. In addition to the calendar schedule and map features, which worked well for planning, organizing and quickly updating our itinerary, I used AI to generate a list of things to do in the area based on certain situations and criteria. Then I was able to share this page with family who are attending the trip. Dislikes: While it's fairly easy to learn how Notion works, it isn't always intuitive and can be a little clunky. It is jam-packed with features and the ability to create around databases, but sometimes it gets in the way of ease and setting things up in a more customized way. Also, Notion's lack of a true search function can be inhibiting when you have a lot of data stored within the app, especially within databases. This has directly impacted how often I use Notion vs other organizational and productivity platforms where I can easily find what I'm looking for amongst various projects. Problems Solved: Notion is excellent for organizing multiple items within multiple business projects. For someone who has multiple projects in gear or in planning at anyone time, Notion keeps me from having to access multiple apps, platforms, databases, and spreadsheets to plan and organize business projects. Also the AI feature cuts down on content writing and idea generation, allowing me to focus on the details of managing various projects. I also use Notion to create a 2nd Brain setup, which furthers the app's usefulness.",

    "content": "Using Notion for work and personal use! Likes: I do like the user design and experience of using Notion! It looks very appealing to the eye - especially using the tables, creating lists, and organizing thoughts together. I feel like the flow of pages makes sense when getting your point across The easy way of how it is seamless with making bullet points (it automatically makes sure the bullet points are consistent without too much work on our end). It's easy to organize a page to how you want it. Dislikes: Understanding Notion does take time. It is a bit overwhelming if you use it for the first time or on an irregular basis. When I try to show Notion to new users, it definitely takes a bit of time to get used to knowing how to navigate + construct pages and tables -- it has people gravitate away from using it. Sometimes I wish the connecting of tables on different pages would be easier to use or integrate, but it may be me that I need to practice more on utilizing this. There are also some functions in the table I wish it could do, for example, more calculation abilities in the table would be amazing! Problems Solved: Notion is solving the hardships people deal with note-taking and they take note-taking to a more simplified level, which is why I enjoy using it. It helps me keep my thoughts and ideas organized -- I like the color coding of it and how easy it is to include emojis and visuals. It is easy to share links with colleagues and friends and create limitations to certain pages and tables that should be kept private vs. public. I benefit by organizing my notes, table trackers, and upcoming plans pages. For work, I benefit from utilizing knowledge-based information on certain topics I am researching or need more insight on. It's nice to have any pages connected to each other that have similar topics -- it helps with finding what I am looking for and learning more along the way.",

    "content": "Notion and Notion AI Likes: What I like most about Notion is how flexible it is. Unlike other apps that kinda force you into using specific templates for a variety of things (like formatted project planning docs or task-oriented to-do lists), Notion gives you a lot of options to organize things your way. And so it's easy to use and customize for everything I need; work, life, and school all in one place. Moreover, the user interface is quite intuitive and easy to navigate. Thus, it's easy to leverage its full suite of features without feeling overwhelmed. I've used it a lot for a lot of things and so I've also adapted my routine to it. Dislikes: There's a number of UI features that could be improved, in my opinion. This includes - ability to organize opened tabs, ability to control default opening view (i.e., new tab or side peek), ability to change margins, and improved use of reminders (like the reminder being turned off if the to-do is done or the task is marked done). Problems Solved: My team primarily uses Notion for project and sprint planning. The AI is very useful in this in terms of making templates for project requirements that help guide the meeting and allow us to think of the items need to be discussed and questions that need to be answered. It also makes it easier to turn bullet point notes into proper and clean documentation. I would say that templating is the strength of the AI assistant. It could use some better scoping though, since sometimes it considers things in the document that I don't necessarily want it to consider when writing or summarizing a part of the document. It is also helpful in putting up a knowledge base. I usually dump all that I have learned in using a tool in bullet points, and the AI is quite helpful in making that understandable.

      "likes": "What I like most about Notion is how flexible it is. Unlike other apps that kinda force you into using specific templates for a variety of things (like formatted project planning docs or task-oriented to-do lists), Notion gives you a lot of options to organize things your way. And so it's easy to use and customize for everything I need; work, life, and school all in one place. Moreover, the user interface is quite intuitive and easy to navigate. Thus, it's easy to leverage its full suite of features without feeling overwhelmed. I've used it a lot for a lot of things and so I've also adapted my routine to it.",
      "dislikes": "There's a number of UI features that could be improved, in my opinion. This includes - ability to organize opened tabs, ability to control default opening view (i.e., new tab or side peek), ability to change margins, and improved use of reminders (like the reminder being turned off if the to-do is done or the task is marked done).",
      "problems_solved": "My team primarily uses Notion for project and sprint planning. The AI is very useful in this in terms of making templates for project requirements that help guide the meeting and allow us to think of the items need to be discussed and questions that need to be answered. It also makes it easier to turn bullet point notes into proper and clean documentation. I would say that templating is the strength of the AI assistant. It could use some better scoping though, since sometimes it considers things in the document that I don't necessarily want it to consider when writing or summarizing a part of the document.\n\nIt is also helpful in putting up a knowledge base.

Notion Ai has been pretty practical and intuitive for me whenever I need to brainstorm ideas on what/how to write something or to improve my notes/documents. As a student, I often use it to organize everything school-related to the schedule and take notes during lectures. I love how it even comes with a student template that allows me to track my schedule and grades. Customer support seems relatively easy to reach. My first time using it, it was hard to understand and learn how to use it. But after getting over the initial stage, it is straightforward and valuable. I like that I can export my notes into various files, and vice versa for importing files into notion. Last of all, the amount of features it offers for free is truly amazing. The price for some of the premium stuff is pretty reasonable. I've been using it for a year and won't stop using it unless otherwise. Dislikes: 1) Not being able to change the font sizes on the documents. 2) Not fully able to import pdf and PowerPoint slides into the pages with the notes in them (instead, it's just imported as the file itself). 3) Not useful for Android tablets. You can write on Notion using iOS, but not Android. I'm taking a few math courses where writing and drawing with the S pen would be handy. That's why I have to use my Samsung notes for any actual note-taking involving writing with the S pen. 4) The app on Android is not as user-friendly. For some reason, it isn't very easy for me to scroll through the pages on the app. I have to place my finger in a particular spot for the scrolling to be in effect. 5) The tutorials are somewhat hard to understand and navigate.

Problems Solved: Notion AI has been beneficial for me in terms of improving my writing, brainstorming ideas for things to write or how to write them, explaining things when needed, etc. I've been able to keep track of all my course assignments because of its schedule.

    "content": "AI Writing Assistant Likes: Notion is a product that I use on a daily basis as a task manager, a note-taking system, and a place to store ideas and thoughts. Since Notion AI was introduced, I have used it to sharpen my notes by using the \"improve writing\" feature, as well as using the summary block to create a brief blurb on my database to find notes quickly and easily. The AI writing assistant also helps me to develop ideas when I'm stuck on how to start something. Asking AI to write something, gives me a template to start and then develop those ideas further. Dislikes: Notion is great for helping to create something tailored to your use case, however, that can be challenging at the beginning, as some may not have the time nor creativity to know what exactly they want to create. It can also sometimes get you bogged down in creating a system to help you, rather than getting on with the work you need to do. However, I have seen Notion developing instructional videos, and there are plenty of resources on YouTube to help you get up and running. Problems Solved: Notion has become my go-to system for all of my daily work. The ability to integrate all of your major work together and be linked so seamlessly helps me to keep track of plans and project details easily.",

AI is super useful for adjusting tone in text, brainstorming ideas & captions for events/social media/marketing materials. I also use a lot for letters, emails & meeting notes. Essential part of our business for managing our multiple projects. I use Notion daily to manage my own & my teams tasks on both desktop & mobile. At first, my boss thought I was super human as my productivity improved drastically (I was using NotionAI when it first released), really great for those moments when an idea is just beginning to form & you need to develop. Dislikes: I sometimes wish Notion was able to organise its own pages & create own wiki based on contents of pages - I know that it is only as good as the information it's being fed. Problems Solved: Consolidation is the most beneficial part in saving employees time in trying to scan various file structures trying to find a document or event - the index tool is amazing as it searches your entire Notion for keywords including page body, links, mentions instead of document titles. Much easier to find a lost document on Notion!",

It's very easy to organise and find things. I can also have separate pages and can share some of the pages with other users. Working in collaboration is great when you need specific tasks to be done or followed up, adding comments or adding reminders it's great to make sure you keep things on track. I have used the AI tool to improve writing or change the tone, and to help writting processes and policies. I find a bit expensive if you are already paying subscriptions so I hope it gets more affordable with time. For personal life, I use to organise information for personal development, like short course links, notes and to add anything relevant. I also use as a tool to organise my CV and writing down emails and cover letters. I have been using the AI tool for that and it's great. Dislikes: There is nothing that I dislike about Notion, overall it's a great tool that I've been using for the long time. It might be a bit tricky to get used for the first time but, after awhile you see the value and how makes things way more easier to get organised and done.

The Notion AI feature is one of the most competent ways of using AI I have seen in any product. Because it is so well integrated into the current working document it generates surprisingly competent results very quickly - e.g. summaries with a prompt for a specific format or to keep writing using an outline of ideas - and in the times it does not do a good job, it's easy to revise or reprompt quickly too. The Notion AI chat feature is also interesting to use. I like how it cites pages within your team's workspace and is so responsive. It's great since I have documents with hundreds of thousands of words altogether that I sometimes need to search from. As a developer, the Notion API and integration with databases is incredible. The centralization of my information all in my workspace is amazing for productivity by using Notion's view tools and also great for rapidly iterating on my apps based on data in Notion. Because of the ease of integrating all my work into Notion, I use it almost every single day, including for personal use as well. When I have had issues, customer support was responsive and kind. Dislikes: Notion's mobile and iPad experience could be greatly improved. While they both are fast and great for reading documents on the go, they aren't perfect experiences for editing. I wish for example that multiple Notion windows could be opened on iPad at once and that the way the iPad cursor worked could be less jittery. Applying styles to text is also not a great experience compared to desktop Notion.

    "content": "A great product for an all to one features that includes GPT Ai functionality Likes: Notion Ai is a feature that allows you to use artificial intelligence to enhance your Notion experience. You can use it to generate content, organize your pages, automate your workflows, and more. It's like having a personal assistant that lives inside your Notion workspace. Sounds amazing, right? Well, it is...and it isn't. Let me explain. First of all, let me tell you what I like about Notion Ai. It's definitely a game-changer for creating content. Whether you need to write a blog post, a newsletter, a presentation, or anything else, Notion Ai can help you out. You just need to give it some keywords or a prompt, and it will generate some text for you in seconds. You can then edit it as you wish, or ask it to rewrite it in a different style or tone. It's like having a professional writer on demand. Another thing I love about Notion Ai is how it can help me organize my pages. Notion is great for creating all kinds of pages, but sometimes it can get messy and hard to find what you need. Notion Ai can solve that problem by automatically creating a table of contents, adding tags and categories, and suggesting related pages. It can also create summaries and overviews of your pages, so you can get a quick glimpse of what they contain. Dislikes: But not everything is perfect with Notion Ai. There are some drawbacks and limitations that you should be aware of before you start using it. One of the biggest issues I have with Notion Ai is how it can sometimes mess up my workflows. Notion is known for its flexibility and customization options, but that also means that everyone has their own way of using it. Notion Ai doesn't always understand or respect that. It can sometimes overwrite or delete my formulas, templates, databases, or integrations. It can also trigger actions that I don't want or expect, such as sending emails, reminders, or notifications. Another problem I have with Notion Ai is how it can sometimes generate inaccurate or irrelevant content. Notion Ai is smart, but not always reliable. It can sometimes make factual errors, grammatical mistakes, or logical fallacies. It can also generate content that doesn't match my keywords, prompt, or purpose. For example, I once asked it to write a blog post about the best productivity apps for 2023, and it gave me a list of apps that were discontinued or outdated. So what's my verdict on Notion Ai? Well, I think it's a great feature that has a lot of potential, but also needs a lot of improvement. It can be very helpful and convenient for some tasks, but also very frustrating and risky for others. I would recommend using it with caution and moderation, and always double-checking its output before publishing or sharing it. Problems Solved: The main problem Notion Ai is solving is summarizing large blocks of text. When I have a large document and I am too lazy, I paste it into Notion and have the Ai summarize or write conclusions for me. I just dump the information in andn request take away points. It is helpful to dump and gather based on the informationn that you have",

    "content": "Act as a great productivity and journaling tool Likes: As a user of Notion, one of the things I love most about it is its incredible flexibility and customization options. Notion allows me to create my own unique workspace tailored to my specific needs and preferences. I can design personalized layouts, templates, and databases that perfectly suit my workflow. This level of customization empowers me to stay organized and work efficiently. Whether I'm managing projects, taking notes, or organizing information, Notion's versatility allows me to adapt the tool to my way of thinking and working. It's truly a game-changer for my productivity Dislikes: While I appreciate many aspects of Notion, I find a few areas somewhat disappointing. One of the things I dislike about Notion is its steep learning curve. It can be overwhelming for new users to understand all the features and functionalities, hindering the onboarding process. Additionally, the initial setup and customization options can feel complex and time-consuming. Another aspect that I find limiting is the lack of offline access. Notion heavily relies on an internet connection, and while it offers a mobile app, the offline functionality is quite limited. This can be inconvenient when I need to access my notes or documents in situations with poor or no internet connectivity. Problems Solved: Notion is a versatile tool that solves several problems, ultimately benefiting me in my work and personal life. One of the key problems it addresses is the need for an all-in-one productivity platform. Instead of relying on multiple applications for note-taking, project management, task tracking, and knowledge organization, Notion brings all these functionalities together in a single tool. This consolidation streamlines my workflow and eliminates the need to switch between different apps, saving me time and effort.",

I just think there's a lot of bloat when it comes to default templates. Problems Solved: Notion providing AI together with my favorite note taking space has truly saved me so much time. Especially when I'm in a crunch and have not figured it out by the time I wanted, I talk to the AI assistant to guide me to the correct solution. I do think that AI is not very accurate. I have asked it many questions and it's answered with tools/libraries that do not exist.

Aditionally the AI tool is in its early stages so telling it convert data to a table is difficult to do or telling to create a cornell note style set is difficult. Rather than create two columns for cornell notes, it creates 2 rows where the questions are on top and the notes are at the bottom. Problems Solved: I can highlight information and tell it to summarize the information for me in a few sentences. Lets say I am taking notes and stumble upon new diction, I can simply highlight the word and ask the AI to define it for me and it would do so below the sentence. It has also made note sharing much easier as I can simply share a link to my notes which will update as I go whereas in other applications I must convert to a PDF file to share to my peers.",

I love how you can organize documents and the variety of available visualizations that are very useful. Additionally, if you have trouble structuring information, there are many helpful templates. I initially started using this software solely for personal use, such as taking daily notes, saving relevant information, or creating task lists, etc. However, I found the application so comprehensive that without realizing it, I began integrating many work-related aspects into it. Eventually, I decided to implement this application as an additional tool for my entire team, and to this day, I believe it has been an excellent decision. Another aspect that I love is the ease of use on any device. I can quickly access my documents from my laptop or cellphone, and any changes are updated swiftly if I'm using both devices simultaneously. Dislikes: Sometimes I use the app to create work logs or notes for certain projects, so I often add photos to my documents. I usually take the pictures within the application, but it can be quite tedious. Many times, the app becomes very slow when doing this, which is something I dislike the most. Moreover, I don't like that I can't rotate my photos. Sometimes, they are displayed incorrectly, and it's quite inconvenient to view them that way. Another aspect is that when the new AI feature was implemented, I started testing this new tool. However, the free attempts were very limited, not enough to evaluate whether I wanted to purchase the subscription or not. Problems Solved: This app is an all-in-one solution. I can create tables, lists, hold meetings, and write documents. The most incredible feature is that I can add code, and it respects the syntax correctly, that's the most valuable aspect for me. I can include any type of information, including photos and audio. I appreciate the high level of customization it offers, I can easily highlight text and if I want to move a paragraph within a document, I don't need to copy and paste, just dragging it is enough. In my work, Notion has made collaboration very easy, being able to create documents that can contain such a variety of information has allowed us to consolidate all our documentation in one place. The updates are reflected instantly, and it has also helped us to organize ourselves better.",

Sometimes, Notion's AI system can make mistakes when classifying files, resulting in incorrect organization of information. Additionally, I have noticed that the suggested tags may not always be relevant or accurate, which requires manual review and correction on my part. Although I appreciate the incorporation of artificial intelligence in Notion as a promising feature, I hope they continue to improve it to ensure greater accuracy and efficiency in the future.

    "content": "Unique utilities but crashing too frequently Likes: I love the fact that Notion AI has the ability to put words in bold and highlight entire sentences. Additionally, its automatic addition of emojis is a delightful feature. Another aspect that I appreciate is how Notion AI selects appropriate words and emojis for me. By utilizing inputs such as \"put important words in bold\" or \"add related emojis,\" it accurately identifies the elements that require emphasis or visual representation. These two reasons contribute to my preference for Notion AI over other available AI options. Furthermore, I value the convenience of having a directly accessible feature to \"fix spelling and grammar\" or \"improve writing.\" Dislikes: The AI feature is experiencing frequent crashes, which disrupt its functionality. Suddenly, it stops performing tasks that it was able to do just moments ago, and error messages like \"request body too large\" appear, even when working with relatively short paragraphs. Additionally, when attempting to import a developed answer into a Notion page, the application crashes and displays the message \"Sorry: that request was too large.\" Despite the answer being generated, the AI box disappears, and the page reverts to its original state. Problems Solved: Notion AI is helping me save time by making the writing process faster. It also saves me money because I don't need to involve another person in repetitive tasks like adding emojis. Additionally, it allows me to develop content ideas and write more easily.",
